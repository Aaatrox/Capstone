## Potential Topics
**Post-Quantum Cryptography**</br>
The idea of cryptography in a post-quantum world is definitely a little frightening to think about, especially when you take the time to consider how much faster quantum computers are than today's modern supercomputers. Even if you construct a long password with unique characters, symbols, and capitalization, it may only take a matter of minutes, maybe even seconds, for a quantum computer to brute force said password. Based on current methods of encrypting passwords and communications, anybody with a quantum capabilities would have access to basically anything they could get their hands on.</br>
For this idea, I would have to explore current methods of cryptogrpahy and why they would be rendered obsolete *when* (not if) quantum computing is successfully achieved. Based on the information gathered from that research, I would then outline methods that could potentially allow for continued secure encyptions, even if a quantum computer attempted to brute force the algorithms used.</br>

**COVID Tracking Application**</br>
Anything having to do with COVID-19 is definitely relevant, especially when it comes to tracking and maybe even mitigating potential exposure. Both major smart phone operating systems and many third-party applications have already rolled out logging systems to help notify individuals of possible exposure through exchanging information via Bluetooth.</br>
For this idea, I would utilize the already existing exposure notification systems found on all major smart devices, or look into how to replicate the functionality of said systems, and then tailor that experience uniquely to the target audience (i.e. college students on campus attending in-person classes or club gatherings).
